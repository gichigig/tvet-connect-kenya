# Assignment Tab Issue - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

**Problem**: When a lecturer creates an assignment as "essay", it displays the document upload tab in the assignment workspace instead of showing the student an essay workspace.

**Root Cause**: The assignment creation form was not creating assignments with the correct `type` field that the `AssignmentWorkplace` component expected.

## 🔧 SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Updated Assignment Creation Form (`AssignmentForm.tsx`)
- **Added "Essay Writing" option** to assignment type dropdown
- **Added `studentType` field mapping**:
  - `essay` → `'essay'` (shows essay workspace)  
  - `file_upload`, `multiple_choice`, `question_file` → `'document'` (shows document upload)
- **Added essay-specific UI** with word limit and AI check options

### 2. Updated Student View (`StudentSemesterPlanView.tsx`)
- **Modified type field usage**: Uses `assignment.studentType` first, falls back to `assignment.type`
- **Updated assignment type checks** for both display and conditional rendering
- **Added debug logging** to track assignment type mapping

### 3. Assignment Creation Mapping
```javascript
// In AssignmentForm.tsx handleSubmit:
const getStudentAssignmentType = (assignmentType: string): 'essay' | 'document' => {
  if (assignmentType === 'essay') return 'essay';
  return 'document'; // file_upload, multiple_choice, question_file all use document interface
};

const assignment = {
  type: "assignment", // For CreatedContent classification
  assignmentType, // Original type for lecturer reference  
  studentType: getStudentAssignmentType(assignmentType), // For student interface
  // ... other fields
};
```

### 4. Student Interface Logic
```typescript
// In StudentSemesterPlanView.tsx:
const finalType = (assignment.studentType || assignment.type || 'document') as 'essay' | 'document';

// Assignment interface selection:
{(assignment.studentType || assignment.type) === 'essay' ? (
  // Essay workspace with AssignmentWorkplace
) : (
  // Document upload interface  
)}

// AssignmentWorkplace props:
type: (assignment.studentType || assignment.type || 'document') as 'essay' | 'document'
```
