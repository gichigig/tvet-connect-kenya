## Essay Workspace Functionality Test

### What was Fixed:
1. **Assignment Creation**: Lecturers can now choose between "Essay Assignment" and "Document Upload" when creating assignments
2. **Student Interface**: Students see different interfaces based on assignment type:
   - Essay assignments → Essay Workspace button
   - Document assignments → File Upload interface
3. **Submission State Management**: After submitting an essay, the workspace button is disabled and shows "Already Submitted"

### Testing Steps:

#### 1. Test Assignment Creation (Lecturer)
1. Go to Assignment Manager
2. Click "Create Assignment"
3. Fill in basic details (title, description, due date)
4. **NEW**: Select "Essay Assignment" mode
5. Notice the UI changes:
   - File upload options are hidden for essay assignments
   - Information panel shows essay features
6. Create the assignment
7. Verify it appears in the assignment table

#### 2. Test Essay Workspace (Student)
1. Navigate to Student Semester Plan
2. View the week containing the essay assignment
3. Notice assignment shows "Type: Essay" instead of "Type: document"
4. Click "Open Essay Workspace" button
5. **NEW**: Essay workspace opens with:
   - Essay title field
   - Large text area for writing
   - Word/character count
   - Auto-save functionality
   - AI check option (if enabled)

#### 3. Test Submission State Management
1. Write some content in the essay workspace
2. Submit the essay
3. **NEW**: After submission:
   - Workspace button becomes "Already Submitted" (disabled)
   - Shows submission date
   - Persists across page refreshes

#### 4. Test Document Assignments (Should work as before)
1. Create assignment with "Document Upload" mode
2. Students should see file upload interface as before
3. No essay workspace available

### Files Modified:
- `AssignmentForm.tsx`: Added essay/document mode selection
- `StudentSemesterPlanView.tsx`: Added essay workspace integration and submission tracking
- Uses existing `AssignmentWorkplace.tsx` component

### Expected Behavior:
- **Before**: All assignments were document upload only, essay workspace never appeared
- **After**: Lecturers can create essay assignments that provide students with essay workspace, and submission state is properly managed
