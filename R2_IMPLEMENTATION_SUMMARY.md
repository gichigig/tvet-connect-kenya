# Cloudflare R2 Storage Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully set up Cloudflare R2 storage integration for your TVET Connect Kenya project. This implementation provides a complete file storage solution with both backend and frontend components.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Backend API (Already Existed - Updated)
**File**: `api-server/routes/upload.js`
- ✅ R2 upload endpoint: `POST /api/upload/upload-course-material`
- ✅ R2 download endpoint: `GET /api/upload/download/:key`
- ✅ Health check endpoint: `GET /api/upload/upload-health`
- ✅ Fixed AWS SDK v3 compatibility issues
- ✅ Proper error handling and file organization

### 2. Frontend Services
**File**: `src/services/R2StorageService.ts`
- ✅ Complete R2 storage service with upload, download, and utility functions
- ✅ File validation (type, size)
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Error handling

### 3. React Hook
**File**: `src/hooks/useR2Storage.ts`
- ✅ Easy-to-use React hook for R2 operations
- ✅ State management for uploads
- ✅ Toast notifications
- ✅ Progress tracking

### 4. React Components
**File**: `src/components/ui/R2FileUpload.tsx`
- ✅ Drag-and-drop file upload component
- ✅ Progress indicator
- ✅ File preview and management
- ✅ Multiple file support

**File**: `src/components/ui/R2FileManager.tsx`
- ✅ File listing and management interface
- ✅ Search and filtering
- ✅ Download, share, and delete actions
- ✅ Category organization

### 5. Example Implementation
**File**: `src/components/examples/NotesUploadExample.tsx`
- ✅ Complete example showing how to integrate R2 upload
- ✅ Metadata management
- ✅ Real-world usage patterns

### 6. Configuration & Testing
**Files**: 
- ✅ `api-server/test-r2-config.js` - Configuration testing script
- ✅ `R2_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup documentation

## Environment Configuration

Your `.env` file already has the correct structure:

```bash
# Storage Configuration
STORAGE_PROVIDER=r2

# Cloudflare R2 Configuration
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
R2_BUCKET_NAME=tvet-connect-kenya-r2
R2_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=https://cdn.tvet-connect-kenya.com
```

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Update Environment Variables
Replace the placeholder values in your `.env` file with actual Cloudflare R2 credentials:

1. **Get Account ID**: From your Cloudflare dashboard
2. **Create R2 API Token**: In R2 settings with read/write permissions
3. **Create Bucket**: Named `tvet-connect-kenya-r2`
4. **Setup Custom Domain** (optional): For better performance

### 2. Configure CORS in Cloudflare R2
Add CORS policy to your R2 bucket to allow browser uploads:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:5173", "http://localhost:3000"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag", "Content-Length"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

### 3. Test the Implementation
Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
cd api-server
node test-r2-config.js
```

### 4. Start Using R2 Storage
Replace existing file upload components with the new R2 components:

```jsx
// Instead of old upload components, use:
import { R2FileUpload } from '@/components/ui/R2FileUpload';

<R2FileUpload
  unitId="CS101"
  unitCode="Computer Science"
  category="material"
  onUploadComplete={(results) => {
    // Handle successful uploads
  }}
/>
```

## Features Included

### File Upload Features
- ✅ Drag and drop interface
- ✅ Multiple file selection
- ✅ File type validation
- ✅ File size validation (50MB limit)
- ✅ Upload progress tracking
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

### File Management Features
- ✅ File listing with metadata
- ✅ Search and filtering
- ✅ Category-based organization
- ✅ Download functionality
- ✅ Share link generation
- ✅ File deletion (optional)

### Developer Experience
- ✅ Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Easy-to-use React hooks
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Toast notifications
- ✅ Progress indicators

## File Organization in R2

Files are organized with this structure:
```
course-materials/
├── {unitId}/
│   ├── timestamp_randomstring.pdf
│   └── ...
```

Each file includes metadata:
- Original filename
- Upload timestamp
- Unit ID and code
- Category (assignment, material, submission, notes)

## Security Features

- ✅ Server-side validation
- ✅ File type restrictions
- ✅ File size limits
- ✅ Secure file URLs
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ API key authentication

## Performance Optimization

- ✅ Direct browser-to-R2 uploads (when using presigned URLs)
- ✅ Custom domain support for CDN
- ✅ Efficient file organization
- ✅ Progress tracking for large files

## Integration Points

The R2 storage system integrates with:
- Assignment submissions
- Course materials
- Student notes
- File sharing
- Download management

## Support for Existing Code

The implementation maintains compatibility with your existing file upload patterns while providing enhanced functionality through R2 storage.

## Ready to Use!

Once you update your environment variables with actual R2 credentials, the entire system is ready to use. You can start uploading files immediately using the provided components and hooks.
