=== Assignment Tab Fix - Test Plan ===

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
   Fix the issue where essay assignments show document upload tab instead of essay workspace tab

✅ CHANGES MADE:
   1. Added "Essay Writing" option to assignment creation form
   2. Added studentType field mapping: essay → 'essay', others → 'document'  
   3. Updated StudentSemesterPlanView to use studentType field
   4. Added essay-specific UI in assignment creation form

🧪 TEST STEPS:

STEP 1: Create Essay Assignment (Lecturer)
   - Login as lecturer
   - Go to Unit Management → Select a unit
   - Create new assignment with type "Essay Writing"
   - Verify essay-specific options appear (word limit, AI check)
   - Submit assignment

STEP 2: Create Document Assignment (Lecturer)  
   - Create another assignment with type "File Upload"
   - Verify file format options appear
   - Submit assignment

STEP 3: Test Student View
   - Login as student
   - Navigate to semester plan for the unit
   - Find the essay assignment
   - Click "Open Essay Workspace" button
   - ✅ VERIFY: Essay workspace tab is ENABLED, document tab is DISABLED
   - ✅ VERIFY: Essay writing interface shows (text area, title field)

STEP 4: Test Document Assignment
   - Find the document assignment
   - ✅ VERIFY: Document upload tab is ENABLED, essay tab is DISABLED  
   - ✅ VERIFY: File upload interface shows

🐛 DEBUG INFO:
   - Check browser console for debug logs showing assignment types
   - Look for "AssignmentWorkplace Debug:" logs
   - Verify finalType shows 'essay' for essay assignments

🔧 DEBUGGING COMMANDS:
   1. Check if assignments have correct fields:
      Object.keys(assignment).filter(key => key.includes('type'))
      
   2. Check assignment object in console:
      console.log('Assignment:', assignment)

📋 EXPECTED RESULTS:
   ✅ Essay assignments → Essay workspace tab enabled
   ✅ Document assignments → Document upload tab enabled  
   ✅ Correct UI shows for each type
   ✅ No more "document upload tab for essays" issue

❌ TROUBLESHOOTING:
   If still not working:
   1. Check semesterPlan sync - assignments might not have new fields
   2. Check assignment creation - verify studentType is set
   3. Clear browser cache/refresh
   4. Check console errors
