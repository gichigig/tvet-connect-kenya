# Semester Plan to Dashboard Sync Implementation

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The semester plan content now properly syncs to lecturer dashboard tabs in real-time. When lecturers create assignments, exams, CATs, notes, and attendance sessions in semester plans, they automatically appear in the corresponding dashboard tabs.

## How It Works

### 1. Content Creation in Semester Plans
When lecturers create content in semester plans:
- **Assignments** → Syncs to "Assignments" tab
- **Exams & CATs** → Syncs to "Exams & CATs" tab  
- **Notes/Materials** → Syncs to "Notes" tab
- **Attendance Sessions** → Syncs to "Attendance" tab
- **Online Classes** → Available in dashboard overview

### 2. Automatic Sync Process
```
Semester Plan Creation → SemesterPlanContext → syncToLecturerDashboard() → API Storage → Dashboard Tabs
```

### 3. Dashboard Integration
Each dashboard tab now shows:
- **Manual content** (created directly in tabs)
- **Synced content** (from semester plans)
- **Clear indicators** showing synced vs manual content
- **Merge without duplicates** based on content ID

## Updated Components

### 1. AssignmentManager.tsx ✅
- Uses `useDashboardSync` hook
- Combines manual + synced assignments
- Shows count: "• X synced from semester plans"
- Displays both types in unified table

### 2. ExamManager.tsx ✅
- Syncs both exams and CATs separately
- Shows synced count badges on tabs
- Handles exam scheduling and management
- Distinguishes between exam types

### 3. NotesManager.tsx ✅
- Syncs course materials and notes
- Shows upload status and file information
- Combines semester plan materials with manual uploads
- Displays week numbers and release schedules

### 4. AttendanceManager.tsx ✅
- **NEW**: Now shows scheduled attendance sessions from semester plans
- Displays session details, venues, and timing
- Shows active/inactive status
- Includes week numbers and session metadata

### 5. useDashboardSync Hook ✅
- Extracts all content types from semester plans
- Maps semester plan structure to dashboard format
- Provides `getContentByType()` for specific content filtering
- Auto-refreshes when semester plans change
- **NEW**: Added `refreshSyncedContent()` for manual refresh

## What Users Will See

### Before (Problem):
- Content created in semester plans didn't appear in dashboard tabs
- Lecturers had to recreate everything manually
- No connection between semester planning and dashboard management
- Duplicate work and inconsistency

### After (Solution):
- ✅ Assignments from semester plans appear in Assignments tab
- ✅ Exams and CATs appear in Exams & CATs tab with proper type distinction
- ✅ Course materials appear in Notes tab with file info
- ✅ Attendance sessions appear in Attendance tab with scheduling details
- ✅ Clear visual indicators show "X synced from semester plans"
- ✅ No duplicates - content appears only once with proper attribution
- ✅ Real-time updates when semester plans change

## Visual Indicators

Each dashboard tab now shows sync status:

```tsx
// Example from AssignmentManager
<p className="text-gray-600">
  Create and manage course assignments 
  {syncedAssignments.length > 0 && (
    <span className="text-blue-600 ml-1">
      • {syncedAssignments.length} synced from semester plans
    </span>
  )}
</p>
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Creation Flow
```
Lecturer creates assignment in SemesterPlanner
↓
addAssignmentToSemesterPlan() in SemesterPlanContext
↓
syncToLecturerDashboard(unitId, assignment, 'assignment')
↓
POST /api/lecturer/dashboard-content
↓
Stored in lecturerDashboardContent Map
```

### 2. Display Flow
```
Lecturer opens Assignments tab
↓
useDashboardSync('lecturer') hook activated
↓
extractContentFromSemesterPlans() extracts all assignments
↓
getContentByType('assignment') filters assignments
↓
Merged with manual assignments in AssignmentManager
↓
Displayed in unified assignment table
```

### 3. Sync Triggers
- When semester plans change (`useEffect` in useDashboardSync)
- When user opens dashboard tabs
- When `refreshSyncedContent()` is called manually
- Real-time via API when content is added

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Sync Function (SemesterPlanContext)
```typescript
const syncToLecturerDashboard = async (unitId: string, content: any, type: string) => {
  // Maps semester plan content to dashboard format
  const dashboardContent = {
    id: content.id,
    type: type,
    title: content.title,
    unitId: unitId,
    lecturerId: unit.lecturerId,
    isFromSemesterPlan: true, // Key identifier
    // ... type-specific fields
  };
  
  // Send to API for cross-session persistence
  await fetch('/api/lecturer/dashboard-content', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(dashboardContent)
  });
};
```

### 2. Content Extraction (useDashboardSync)
```typescript
// Extracts all content types from semester plans
semesterPlan.weekPlans.forEach(week => {
  // Extract assignments
  week.assignments?.forEach(assignment => {
    content.push({
      ...assignment,
      isFromSemesterPlan: true,
      weekNumber: week.weekNumber
    });
  });
  // ... similar for exams, notes, attendance
});
```

### 3. Dashboard Integration (Managers)
```typescript
// Combine manual and synced content
const allAssignments = [
  ...manualAssignments,
  ...syncedAssignments.filter(synced => 
    !manualAssignments.some(manual => manual.id === synced.id)
  )
];
```

## Testing Results

All sync verification tests pass:
- ✅ All manager components use `useDashboardSync`
- ✅ SemesterPlanContext has proper sync functions
- ✅ useDashboardSync extracts all content types
- ✅ API endpoints support dashboard sync
- ✅ No duplicate content display

## User Testing Guide

### Step 1: Create Semester Plan Content
1. Login as lecturer
2. Go to "Semester Planning" 
3. Create a semester plan for your unit
4. Add assignments, exams, notes, attendance sessions

### Step 2: Verify Dashboard Sync
1. Navigate to "Lecturer Dashboard"
2. Check each tab:
   - **Assignments**: Should show semester plan assignments with sync indicator
   - **Exams & CATs**: Should show scheduled exams/CATs with week info
   - **Notes**: Should show uploaded materials with file details
   - **Attendance**: Should show scheduled sessions with venue/timing

### Step 3: Look for Sync Indicators
- Blue text showing "• X synced from semester plans"
- Content marked with week numbers
- Mix of manual and synced content without duplicates

### Troubleshooting
If content isn't syncing:
1. Check browser console for sync errors
2. Verify API server is running (`npm start` in api-server)
3. Refresh the page to reload synced content
4. Check that lecturer ID matches between semester plan and dashboard

## Next Steps

The sync system is now complete and working. Users can:
1. Create comprehensive semester plans
2. See all content automatically appear in dashboard tabs
3. Manage both synced and manual content from single interface
4. Track content origin (semester plan vs manual creation)

This eliminates the duplicate work and ensures consistency between semester planning and daily dashboard management.
