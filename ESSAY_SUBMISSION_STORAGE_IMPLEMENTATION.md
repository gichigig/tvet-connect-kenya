# Essay Submission Storage Implementation

## Overview
This implementation replaces localStorage-based essay submission tracking with a robust API-based storage system using Firestore. Essays are now stored persistently on the server, ensuring data consistency and availability across devices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes (StudentSemesterPlanView.tsx)

#### Before:
- Essay submissions were stored in browser localStorage
- Data was tied to specific browser/device
- No server-side persistence
- Risk of data loss on browser clear/reset

#### After:
- Essay submissions are stored in Firestore via API calls
- Data persists across all devices and browsers
- Server-side storage with proper error handling
- Loading states during API operations

### 2. API Implementation (api-server/routes/assignments.js)

Created a new assignments route with the following endpoints:

#### GET `/api/assignments/submissions/student/:studentId/unit/:unitId`
- Retrieves all essay submissions for a specific student and unit
- Used on component mount to load existing submissions
- Filters by `submissionType: 'essay'`

#### POST `/api/assignments/submissions`
- Creates new essay submissions or updates existing ones
- Handles both create and update operations
- Validates required fields (assignmentId, studentId, unitId)
- Returns created/updated submission data

#### GET `/api/assignments/submissions/:submissionId`
- Retrieves a specific submission by ID
- Used for detailed submission viewing

#### DELETE `/api/assignments/submissions/:submissionId`
- Removes a submission from storage
- Includes existence validation

#### GET `/api/assignments/assignment/:assignmentId/submissions`
- Gets all submissions for a specific assignment
- Useful for lecturers to view all student submissions

### 3. Database Structure

Essays are stored in Firestore collection `assignmentSubmissions` with this schema:

```javascript
{
  assignmentId: string,      // Assignment this submission belongs to
  studentId: string,         // Student who submitted
  unitId: string,           // Unit/course ID
  submissionType: string,   // 'essay' for essay submissions
  content: string,          // The essay content/text
  title: string,            // Essay title
  submittedAt: string,      // ISO timestamp of submission
  status: string,           // 'submitted', 'late', 'draft'
  wordCount: number,        // Word count of essay
  aiCheckResult: object,    // AI plagiarism check results
  metadata: object,         // Additional submission metadata
  createdAt: string,        // ISO timestamp of creation
  updatedAt: string         // ISO timestamp of last update
}
```

### 4. Server Integration (server.js)

Added assignments route registration:
```javascript
import assignmentsRoutes from './routes/assignments.js';
app.use('/api/assignments', authenticateApiKey, assignmentsRoutes);
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Data Persistence
- Submissions are now permanently stored on server
- Available across all devices and browsers
- Survives browser cache clears and reinstalls

### 2. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for API failures
- Fallback behavior when server is unavailable
- User feedback via toast notifications

### 3. Loading States
- Visual loading indicators during API operations
- Prevents user interaction during data fetching
- Clear submission status display

### 4. Data Consistency
- Single source of truth on server
- Prevents data conflicts between devices
- Automatic updates across all sessions

## Usage Flow

### Student Perspective:
1. Opens assignment in semester plan
2. System loads existing submissions from API
3. If no submission exists, essay workspace is available
4. Student writes essay and submits
5. Submission is stored on server via API
6. Workspace button becomes disabled showing "Already Submitted"
7. Submission persists across browser sessions and devices

### Technical Flow:
1. Component mounts → `loadEssaySubmissions()` called
2. API GET request to fetch existing submissions
3. Submissions stored in component state
4. When essay submitted → `saveEssaySubmission()` called
5. API POST request to create/update submission
6. Local state updated to reflect new submission
7. UI updated to show submission status

## Environment Requirements

### API Server:
- Firestore database access
- API key authentication middleware
- Express.js routing

### Frontend:
- API_BASE_URL environment variable
- API_KEY environment variable
- Toast notification system
- Loading state management

## Error Scenarios Handled

1. **API Server Down**: Graceful degradation with error messages
2. **Network Issues**: Retry capability and user feedback
3. **Authentication Failures**: Clear error messages
4. **Database Errors**: Proper error logging and user notification
5. **Invalid Data**: Input validation and sanitization

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Authentication**: All endpoints require valid API key
2. **Data Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
3. **Student Isolation**: Students can only access their own submissions
4. **Audit Trail**: Creation and update timestamps tracked

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Submission Creation**: Test creating new essay submissions
2. **Submission Loading**: Verify submissions load correctly on component mount
3. **Cross-Device Sync**: Test submission availability across different browsers/devices
4. **Network Failures**: Test behavior when API server is unavailable
5. **Concurrent Submissions**: Test handling of simultaneous submission attempts

## Monitoring

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:
- API request/response logging
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance metrics for submission operations
- Database query optimization tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live submission status
2. **Offline Support**: Service worker for offline submission queuing
3. **Collaboration Features**: Multi-user editing capabilities
4. **Version History**: Track submission revision history
5. **Analytics**: Submission patterns and performance metrics
