# 🎯 Semester Plan Visibility Solution - Implementation Complete

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

### **Issue**: 
Students couldn't see semester plan materials even though lecturers had created them.

### **Root Cause**: 
Materials were defaulting to `isVisible: false` when created, and there was no UI for lecturers to publish them.

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Material Visibility Toggle System**
- **Added `toggleMaterialVisibility()` function** in `SemesterPlanner.tsx`
- **Added Publish/Hide buttons** for each material with Eye/EyeOff icons
- **Added visual status badges** showing "Published" (green) or "Draft" (gray)
- **Added toast notifications** when materials are published/hidden

### **2. Default Visibility Changed**
- **Changed default from `isVisible: false` to `isVisible: true`**
- **New materials are now visible to students immediately**
- **Lecturers can still hide materials if needed using the toggle**

### **3. UI Enhancements**
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Clear badges showing publication status
- **Intuitive Controls**: Green "Publish" button for drafts, red "Hide" button for published
- **Immediate Feedback**: Toast messages confirm actions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## 🎨 **Visual Design**

### **Published Materials**:
- ✅ Green "Published" badge with Eye icon
- ✅ Green "Hide" button to unpublish

### **Draft Materials**:
- 📝 Gray "Draft" badge with EyeOff icon  
- 📝 Green "Publish" button to make visible

## 📚 **How It Works**

### **For Lecturers**:
1. Create materials in the Semester Planner
2. Materials are **automatically published** (visible to students)
3. Use the "Hide" button to make materials private if needed
4. Use the "Publish" button to make hidden materials visible again

### **For Students**:
1. Access semester plans through StudentSemesterPlanView
2. **Only see published materials** (isVisible: true)
3. Materials appear immediately when lecturers publish them
4. No access to draft/hidden materials

## 🔄 **Filtering Logic**

### **Student View Filter** (in SemesterPlanContext):
```typescript
materials: week.materials?.filter(material => material.isVisible) || []
```

### **Lecturer View** (in SemesterPlanner):
- Shows all materials (published and draft)
- Visual indicators for status
- Toggle controls for each material

## 🚀 **Current Status**

### **✅ Implemented Features**:
- Material visibility toggle system
- Visual status indicators
- Default visibility set to true
- Toast notifications
- Responsive UI design

### **🎯 Result**:
- **Students can now see semester plan materials immediately**
- **Lecturers have full control over material visibility**
- **Clear visual feedback for publication status**
- **Seamless user experience for both roles**

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

1. Go to Lecturer Dashboard → Unit Management
2. Select a unit and click "Manage"
