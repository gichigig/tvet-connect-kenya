## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Assignment Creation Enhancement (Lecturer Side)
**File**: `src/components/lecturer/assignment-manager/AssignmentForm.tsx`

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ Added **Assignment Mode Selection**: Radio buttons to choose between "Essay Assignment" and "Document Upload"
- ✅ **Conditional UI**: Show different options based on assignment mode
- ✅ **Assignment Type Logic**: Use `formData.assignmentMode` to set assignment type
- ✅ **AI Check Integration**: Automatically enable AI check for essay assignments

**New UI Features**:
```tsx
// Assignment Mode Selection
<div className="space-y-2">
  <Label>Assignment Mode</Label>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    <label className="flex items-center space-x-2 p-3 border rounded-lg">
      <input type="radio" name="assignmentMode" value="essay" />
      <div>
        <div className="font-medium">Essay Assignment</div>
        <div className="text-sm text-gray-500">Students write essays using the built-in workspace</div>
      </div>
    </label>
    <label className="flex items-center space-x-2 p-3 border rounded-lg">
      <input type="radio" name="assignmentMode" value="document" />
      <div>
        <div className="font-medium">Document Upload</div>
        <div className="text-sm text-gray-500">Students upload files (PDF, DOC, etc.)</div>
      </div>
    </label>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 2. Student Assignment Interface (Student Side)
**File**: `src/components/student/StudentSemesterPlanView.tsx`

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ **Essay Submission Tracking**: localStorage-based persistence for submission state
- ✅ **Conditional Interface**: Different UI for essay vs document assignments
- ✅ **Workspace Integration**: Full integration with existing `AssignmentWorkplace` component
- ✅ **Submission State Management**: Disable workspace button after submission

**Essay Submission Logic**:
```tsx
// Track submissions with localStorage persistence
const [essaySubmissions, setEssaySubmissions] = useState<Map<string, any>>(() => {
  try {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem(`essay-submissions-${user?.id}-${unitId}`);
    if (stored) {
      const submissions = JSON.parse(stored);
      return new Map(Object.entries(submissions));
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load essay submissions:', error);
  }
  return new Map();
});

// Save submission with persistence
const saveEssaySubmission = (assignmentId: string, submission: any) => {
  const newSubmissions = new Map(essaySubmissions.set(assignmentId, submission));
  setEssaySubmissions(newSubmissions);
  
  try {
    const submissionsObj = Object.fromEntries(newSubmissions);
    localStorage.setItem(`essay-submissions-${user?.id}-${unitId}`, JSON.stringify(submissionsObj));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to save essay submission:', error);
  }
};
```

**Assignment Interface Logic**:
```tsx
{/* Assignment Interface - Different for Essay vs Document */}
{assignment.type === 'essay' ? (
  essaySubmissions.has(assignment.id) ? (
    <div className="mt-4">
      <Button disabled className="w-full">
        <CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
        Already Submitted
      </Button>
      <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
        Essay submitted on {format(submissionDate, 'MMM d, yyyy p')}
      </p>
    </div>
  ) : (
    <AssignmentWorkplace
      assignment={essayAssignmentData}
      onSubmissionComplete={(submission) => {
        saveEssaySubmission(assignment.id, submission);
        toast({ title: "Essay Submitted", description: "Your essay has been submitted successfully" });
      }}
      trigger={
        <Button className="w-full mt-4">
          <PenTool className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
          Open Essay Workspace
        </Button>
      }
    />
  )
) : (
  <StudentAssignmentUpload {...documentUploadProps} />
)}
```
