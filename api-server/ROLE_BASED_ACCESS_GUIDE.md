# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## 🔐 Overview

The system now implements role-based access control for application management:

- **HOD (Head of Department)**: Manages deferment applications and academic clearances
- **Finance Department**: Manages financial clearances and fee-related matters
- **Admin**: Manages library, hostel, and general clearances

## 📋 Role Responsibilities

## 🔒 Access Control Matrix

| Application Type | HOD | Finance | Admin |
|------------------|-----|---------|-------|
| Academic Clearance | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Financial Clearance | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Library Clearance | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Hostel Clearance | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| General Clearance | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Deferment Applications | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## 🎯 Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. **API Key Authentication**: All role-based endpoints require valid API key
2. **Permission Verification**: Each endpoint checks for specific permissions
3. **Role-Based Filtering**: Data is filtered based on user role
4. **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged with reviewer role information

### Database Schema Updates
```javascript
// Enhanced application documents now include:
{
  // ... existing fields
  reviewedBy: "John Doe",
  reviewedByRole: "HOD" | "Finance" | "Admin",
  reviewedAt: "2025-08-03T10:30:00.000Z",
  reviewComment: "Optional comment from reviewer"
}
```

### Security Features
- **Type-Based Access Control**: Each role can only access specific application types
- **Permission-Based Authorization**: Granular permissions for read/write access
- **Cross-Role Prevention**: Prevents unauthorized access across departments
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks who processed each application

## 📱 Frontend Integration

### HOD Dashboard Example
```javascript
// Get HOD dashboard statistics
const statsResponse = await fetch('/api/hod/dashboard-stats', {
  headers: { 'x-api-key': apiKey }
});
const stats = await statsResponse.json();

// Display: pending deferments, academic clearances, etc.
```

### Finance Dashboard Example
```javascript
// Get financial clearances
const clearancesResponse = await fetch('/api/finance/clearance-applications', {
  headers: { 'x-api-key': apiKey }
});
const clearances = await clearancesResponse.json();

// Each clearance includes fee balance information for context
```

### Admin Dashboard Example
```javascript
// Get clearances (library, hostel, general only)
const clearancesResponse = await fetch('/api/admin/clearance-applications', {
  headers: { 'x-api-key': apiKey }
});
const clearances = await clearancesResponse.json();

// Will only return library, hostel, and general clearances
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Permission Setup
Each user/API key needs appropriate permissions:

```javascript
// HOD permissions
const hodPermissions = [
  'hod:deferment:read',
  'hod:deferment:write',
  'hod:clearance:read',
  'hod:clearance:write',
  'hod:dashboard:read'
];

// Finance permissions
const financePermissions = [
  'finance:clearance:read',
  'finance:clearance:write',
  'finance:fees:read',
  'finance:payments:write',
  'finance:dashboard:read'
];

// Admin permissions
const adminPermissions = [
  'admin:clearance:read',
  'admin:clearance:write',
  'admin:fees:read',
  'admin:fees:write',
  'admin:units:read'
];
```
