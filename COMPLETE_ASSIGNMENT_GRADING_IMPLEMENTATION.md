# 🎓 Complete Assignment & Grading System Implementation

## 📋 Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive assignment and grading system for TVET Connect Kenya that integrates with the grade-vault-tvet system. This implementation includes a professional assignment workplace, complete grading workflows, HOD approval systems, and seamless integration with the existing grade management infrastructure.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. 🏢 Assignment Workplace (`AssignmentWorkplace.tsx`)

**Professional workspace for students to complete assignments:**

- **Essay Editor**: Full-featured text editor with real-time word/character count
- **Document Upload**: Support for PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT files with validation
- **Auto-Save**: Automatic draft saving every 30 seconds with timestamp tracking
- **AI Plagiarism Detection**: Real-time originality checking for essays
- **Assignment Instructions**: Clear display of requirements and guidelines
- **Deadline Tracking**: Visual warnings for late submissions
- **Draft Recovery**: Resume work from previously saved drafts

**Key Features:**
```typescript
interface AssignmentWorkplaceProps {
  assignment: Assignment;
  existingSubmission?: any;
  onSubmissionComplete: (submission: any) => void;
  onSaveDraft?: (draftData: any) => void;
  savedDraft?: any;
  trigger?: React.ReactNode;
}
```

### 2. 🔄 Assignment Workflow Hook (`useAssignmentWorkflow.ts`)

**Manages the complete assignment lifecycle:**

- **Draft Management**: Save, load, and manage assignment drafts
- **Grade-Vault Integration**: Submit assignments to grade-vault-tvet system
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor grading progress in real-time
- **Data Synchronization**: Sync between main app and grade-vault

**Core Functionality:**
```typescript
interface UseAssignmentWorkflowReturn {
  drafts: { [assignmentId: string]: DraftData };
  submissions: GradeVaultSubmission[];
  saveDraft: (draftData: DraftData) => void;
  submitToGradeVault: (submissionData: any) => Promise<void>;
  getSubmissionStatus: (assignmentId: string) => GradeVaultSubmission | null;
  syncWithGradeVault: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### 3. 📊 Grade Display Component (`GradeDisplay.tsx`)
